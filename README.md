# 🧠 Health Recommendation System using Fitbit Data

🚀 A complete end-to-end data science project that builds a **personalized health and wellness recommendation system** using real-world Fitbit activity data.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

* 🔄 End-to-end data science pipeline
* 📊 Real-world Fitbit dataset analysis
* 🤖 Recommendation system using implicit feedback
* 📈 Insight-driven health analytics

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project develops a **personalized recommendation system** by analyzing user behavior from wearable device data, including:

* Daily physical activity
* Sleep patterns
* Heart rate trends

Unlike traditional systems that rely on ratings, this project uses **implicit feedback (user activity presence)** to model behavior and generate recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Wearable devices generate large volumes of behavioral data, but lack explicit feedback.
The challenge is to:

> Predict user behavior and generate meaningful recommendations using only implicit signals.

---

## 🧩 Methodology

### 1. Data Integration

* Merged multiple Fitbit datasets into a unified structure
* Aggregated sleep and heart rate to daily level

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values using implicit feedback logic
* Standardized features for modeling

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Identified activity trends and behavior patterns
* Analyzed feature relationships and correlations

### 4. Recommendation Models

* Popularity-Based Model
* Item-Item Collaborative Filtering
* Matrix Factorization (NMF)

### 5. Model Evaluation

* Precision@5
* Recall@5
* F1 Score
* NDCG
